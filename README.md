# Logistic Regression


## Introduction
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value.
## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is used for a different class of problems known as classification problems. Here the aim is to predict the group to which the current object under observation belongs to. It gives you a discrete binary outcome between 0 and 1.

Comparison to linear regression
-------------------------------

Given data on time spent studying and exam scores. :doc:`linear_regression` and logistic regression can predict different things:

  - **Linear Regression** could help us predict the student's test score on a scale of 0 - 100. Linear regression predictions are continuous (numbers in a range).

  - **Logistic Regression** could help use predict whether the student passed or failed. Logistic regression predictions are discrete (only specific values or categories are allowed). We can also view probability scores underlying the model's classifications.

Types of logistic regression
----------------------------

  - Binary (Pass/Fail)
  - Multi (Cats, Dogs, Sheep)
  - Ordinal (Low, Medium, High)
